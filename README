Purpose
	Emulate the behavior of 100's of interactive users submitting database queries
	in an arbitrary order with random think times to
	a (typically) smaller number of interactive SQL client sessions.
	It uses a simple configuration file to define classes of users, 
	each with their own workload characteristics.
Description
	Uses python/pexpect to spawn a specified number of database clients.
	Queues and threading are used to 'funnel' $N emulated users into $M sessions.
Usage
	amuse.py -f <conf-file> -r <run-secs> -v
Output
	Each emulated user records query names and response times in its own log file
Sample conf file
	db acquia_drupal
	sqldir .
	# Define 1st group (groupID=grp1; #users=10; #sessions=4; uname=root; pwd(optional))
	group grp1 10 4 root
	# Define queries for this group (query ID; query file; count; think-time(secs))
	query q1 test1.sql 100 2
	query q2 test2.sql  50 6
	query q3 test3.sql  10 10
